## 1st Day.

 Firstoff all I'm starting with arrays in arrays it will take almost 7 to 8 days to complete the all the concepts in arrays and also **solving the problems is very important and crucial in DSA guys**
## what is mean by an array ?

- Array is a linear data sturucture and also a data type , **which is used to store the values in sequence manner is called an array**

let us consider a example, we have 100 students of data like Roll number , name and section etc..,   
- Can we store all students data in a single variable like Roll number, name or section **plzz think for some time** 
-  It is not possible to store 100 students of data in a single variable that's only we are using **Arrays to store the data in sequence manner**
-let's see one example:-
```java

int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 

```
## How many ways to intialize a array in java.

- There are 2 ways to initialize an array in java

1. Static assignment.

2. Dynamic assignment.


```java
// Static assignment.

//Data_type  name_of_array followed by squarebrackets = inside flower brackets you want write what type of data you wanna store.
int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5};

```


```java

// Dynamic assignment.

//Data_type name of array followed by squarebrackets = by using new keyword followed by Data_type followed by squarebrackets.
//Note: you want to declare the size of an array inside square brackets in dynamic as well as static also . In static methods don't require the size of an array.

// In dynamic assignment when ever we are using new keyword in java then it will automatically creates a object of that type here array is also a object in java.

int array [] = new int[5];

//here 5 is the size of an array .
