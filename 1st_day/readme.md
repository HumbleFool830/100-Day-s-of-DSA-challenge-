## 1st Day.

 Firstoff all I'm starting with arrays in arrays it will take almost 7 to 8 days to complete the all the concepts in arrays and also **solving the problems is very important and crucial in DSA guys**
## what is mean by an array ?

- Array is a linear data sturucture and also a data type , **which is used to store the values in sequence manner is called an array**

let us consider a example, we have 100 students of data like Roll number , name and section etc..,   
- Can we store a all students data in a single variable like Roll number, name or section **plzz think for some time** 
-  It is not possible to store 100 students of data in a single variable that's only we are using **Arrays to store the data in sequence manner**
-let's see one example:-
```java

int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 

```
